In computing and computer science, a processor or processing unit is an electrical component (digital circuit) that performs operations on an external data source, usually memory or some other data stream.[1] It typically takes the form of a microprocessor, which can be implemented on a single metal–oxide–semiconductor integrated circuit chip. In the past, processors were constructed using multiple individual vacuum tubes,[2][3] multiple individual transistors,[4] or multiple integrated circuits. Today, processors use built-in transistors.[5][6]

The term is frequently used to refer to the central processing unit (CPU) in a system.[7] However, it can also refer to other coprocessors, such as a graphics processing unit (GPU).[8]

Traditional processors are typically based on silicon; however, researchers have developed experimental processors based on alternative materials such as carbon nanotubes,[9] graphene,[10] and alloys made of elements from groups three and five of the periodic table.[11] Transistors made of a single sheet of silicon atoms one atom tall and other 2D materials have been researched for use in processors.[12] Quantum processors have been created; they use quantum superposition to represent bits (called qubits) instead of only an on or off state.[
